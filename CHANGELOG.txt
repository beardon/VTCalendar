2.3.0 Alpha (not yet released)
--------------------------------

Note: The list below is a work-in-progress. 

Major:
- New "Upcoming" tab that shows all un-expired events in the next 365 days (can be modified in config.inc.php).
- Most styling has been moved to CSS.
- New admin screen for colors, with greatly expanded control over the calendar's colors.
- HTTP authentication (if you have a script somewhere that does some sort of custom auth).
- Upcoming events can be displayed on other Web sites by inserting one line of JavaScript into the site. See http://www.howard.edu/calendar/public-export/instructions.php for details.
- A wizard upgrades the database as necessary between versions (including 2.2.2 to 2.3.0).

Minor:
- Friendly error messages displayed for DB errors and missing external components (e.g. DB.php).
- "My Submitted Events" screen now shows events for one month at a time, avoiding a huge list of all events. 
- "Manage Calendars" screen can now show total events for each calendar. Also shows total upcoming events, to determine if a calendar is not being used.
- No longer necessary to re-login when switching calendars. 
- Main admins no longer need to be sponsors in order to view a calendar. 
- Main admins can become any sponsor for a calendar on-the-fly. 
- More user-friendly admin screen and add/edit event form.
- Mini-calendar column can be toggled to be on left or right. Having it on the right helps users with low resolutions.
- More fine grained control of LDAP authentication.
- New weekday repeating event choices (e.g. every sunday).
- Forced 'calendarid' in links to make sure calendar the right calendar is displayed when multiple calendars are being used by one person.
- "ROBOT" meta-tag added to header to so that spiders only index the event pages, and not the day/week/month views.
- The page title (<title>) now includes specific information about the page. For example, when looking a day's events, it will read "Day: Wednesday, September 10, 2008" rather than just "Day". Events will include the event title.
- Page title can now have a string appended to the beginning and end for all calendars. 
- Duration of the event now appears with the start time in day/week view.
- Events now fade to gray when their end-time has passed, or if the next day is reached in the case of "all day" events.
- Added message to approval page that the event will also be submitted to default calendar (if applicable).
- When a new calendar is created, only one category is created named "General".
