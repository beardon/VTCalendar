TODO for Version 2.x:
===========================

High:
- Move all lang files to languages/en.inc.php
- Update install/upgradedb.php for PostgreSQL.
- Add a customizable prefix for table names to support multiple sets of vtcalendar tables within one Postgres database:
  Search: (?<!"\.TABLEPREFIX\.")(?<![."'])(?=vtcal_(adminuser|admin|calendar|calendarviewauth|category|colors|event|searchedkeywords|searchfeatured|searchkeyword|searchlog|sponsor|template|user))
  Replace: ".TABLEPREFIX."
- Validate iCalendar export format.
- Check help text to see if it is still accurate.
- Change 'Jump To' in column back to being a single drop-down.
- Allow data currently stored in session to be loaded from the DB or a file.
- Update search logging/reporting so that it knows keywords can only be up to 255 characters.

Low:
- Assign DB results by reference. Example: $var =& DBQuery(...) or $results =& $db->query(...)
- Get row by reference. Example $row =& $results->fetchRow()
- Free results by using $results->free()
- Properly handle string returns from functions like DBQuery.
- Expand AUTH_HTTP_CACHE to LDAP
- Improve the way AUTH_HTTP checks if the authentication was successful or not successful by also checking the body text.
- Allow events to be flagged private so that you can only see them if you log in.
- "Send event to a friend" form.
- Allow week/month to be viewed as a list of events (like upcoming view).
- A 'comments' field for sponsors where additional information (e.g. mailing address or phone number) could be stored.
- Include file from static-includes before sub-calendar headers, and after sub-calendar footers.
- Develop tool for assisting with translations.
- Store IP if logged in and logout if IP changes.

Future:
- A public submit an event form that submits on behalf of a non-admin sponsor (the calendar admin decides which).
  Events submitted this way would also need an e-mail address (and other contact info) for the person submitting the event.
  A confirmation e-mail would be sent to the address with a link the submitted will need to click to act as a spam filter.
  When the event is accepted or rejected, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the submitter as well.

Finished:
- Improve 'Upcoming' print view (Finished 08-10-15)
- Disable admin buttons/icons in print view (Finished 08-10-15)
- Disable AJAX in month view for little calendar month-navigation arrows.
- Add helpsignup.php link back to displaylogin() in functions.inc.php
- Should probably remove checking for HTTPS and just use SECUREBASEURL for the action of any forms that need to be secured. Search scripts for: _SERVER['HTTPS']
- Filters need to work on upcoming events view.
- A message should output when a keyword is being used in day/week/month view. There is currently no way for a user to know its filtering.
- $iday['css'] and $iday['color'] should be removed if not being used.
- Check current database schema vs 2.2.2.
- Determine what 'detailscaller' did and if they can be removed.
- Why was the saveall button disabled? ((Logic was unstable. Was removed in 2.2.2))
- Add colors to vtcal_colors for new CSS
- Allow SMTP e-mail via Pear::Mail.
- Check input validation constants in constants.inc.php to determine the correct values and merge the constants as necessary.
- Static files are now included pre/post the header/footer for sub-calendars. This allows for mandatory header/footer HTML.
- Added new "view authentication" mode that allows any successfully authenticated user to view the calendar.

TODO for Version 3.x:
- Modular DB
- Modular authentication
- Approval chain
- Allow any sponsor to be the end of the approval chain, to allow sponsors that can make events public without having access to modify the calendar settings.
- Allow 'additional categories' for events, which would be used when a user filters the calendar.
- Allow URLs to built programmatically to allow links like http://localhost/vtcalendar/{calendarid}/{eventid} or http://localhost/vtcalendar/{calendarid}/month/2008-01
- Allow an instance of an event to be separated from the original repeating event. This would essentially be a copy, followed by adding an exclude to the repeating definition once the copy is posted.
- Event details appear in small box when hovering over event in month/week/day view.
- Database connection persistence?

OLD TODO:
===========================

FEATURES
--------
X don't allow calendar admins to lock themselves out from the calendar by restricting access
- search by sponsor
- display email addresses as javascript to protect against spammers
- harden against cross-site scripting attacks
X make "manage users" available in default calendar for all newly created calendars (from Andre: Not sure what this means, but main admins can always access calendars now)
  (important for setting passwords when LDAP is not used)
- document export parameters timebegin=today and rangedays=30
- document difference between a calendar and categories

BUGS
----
- when admin edits an "to-be-approved" item it is automatically approved (which is OK) but
also becomes the event of the admin (which is not OK)
- using the filter resets the calendar to the view that includes today
- userids are sometime case sensitive, sometimes not -> you may be able to login with an upper/lowercase Id but not "Manage users" for example


IDEAS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------
- iCal import
- sorted log
- have a print view for the calendar
- have a calendar output designed for pocket PC
- implement a year view that highlights certain admin or user-defined categories
- make it an option whether or not the admin gets an email upon a new event submission (the admin should be able to change that)
- remember search parameter after using the back button
- have a feature to allow copy of all search results via vCalendar/iCalendar
- improve search further (take out special characters [intelligently]) e.g. "parents' day"
